# KungFuConsole

An exploration of a board game idea I have and also an opportunity to experiment with a new type of AI that can be run in reverse for level development. The idea is that in this simple game levels will be designed essentially from a end point running backwards to the player's starting position thereby making each game random but always solvable. If I meet with success in this I will likely create a graphical version of the game in Mono down the track. For now I am staying in a console environment to stay focused on the backend development of features. 

I feel like this would be a fun way to make a randomised strategy game. While there is a lot of work on AI development in more traditional avenues for gaming and the less traditional concepts of training machine learning. I feel this is a good path forward for random setups though because the nature of a turn based strategy game could cause a good AI to render a problem unsolvable. While this could be solved for the nature of such solutions would inevitably lead to a similar result as to what I intend to achieve in this project from the outset. 

The AI will develop from an emergent behaviour of simple pieces and rules to hopefully create an enjoyable experience.
